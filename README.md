# SysSet

This is an automated system set-up script I wrote between 2002 & 2005.
It was written to streamline and speed up server installs, and rebuilds.

I am reliably informed that some form of this script was still being used up until 2020.

Some of the scripting in here is now a mystery to me.
(see -n in SysSet - I REALLY didn't want people to use that as a runtime switch apparently)

Also, some of this stuff may have been built upon scripts that existed before.
